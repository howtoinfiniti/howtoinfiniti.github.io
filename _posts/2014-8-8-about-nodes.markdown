<h2 class="page-subtitle" ><small>1.</small> Nodes in the CMS</h2>

A node can be practicaly anything inside the CMS, from a Slideshow, a Link Farm or a simple Flyout to a whole VLP or Photos & Colours page. Essentially they are the "meat" of the content author, so learn how to work with them is fairly important.

Actions you can perform with a node:

- Copy
- Delete
- Change its position
- Edit
